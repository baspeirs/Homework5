// first, create the body, we will need 24 sections to fill out a full day
    // create each section individually in html
    // assign each section its own id, but the same class
    // assign each section its corrisponding time (12am to 11:59pm)
    // give each hour some text area for user input, and a submit button to apply it to the page
    // use normal time for the visible sections
    // maybe add a scroll to each input section? 

// wright a script that
    // is able to grab the users local time(from the browser probably?)
    // changes the id of each box as hours pass
        // if time is > section time ---> change class to .grey
        // if time === section time (roughly) ---> change class to .red
        // if time < section time ---> class = .green (standard)
    // use military time for the script
    // use local time (probalby from browser) to grab the date and append it to the bottom of the header
